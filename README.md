### About Me
I started in game development with Microsoft in 2000 (DirectX, Xbox ATG, Microsoft Game Studios).  While at Microsoft I shipped DX8-DX9.1, Xbox 360 and a number of games (Mass Effect, 1 vs 100 on XBox Live, Microsoft Flight, Kinect Star Wars, etc).  Post-Microsoft I've worked for Electronic Arts (PopCap), and enjoyed game development overseas - twice (Bangkok, Thailand and Hong Kong, SAR China).

### About My Role
I'm currently Director Of Technology for Gamergenic, a Bellevue WA USA game developer.  Part of this role is managing communications between Gamergenic and other game developers (via github, discord, and blog posts).
